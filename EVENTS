Events
------

sfEasyAuth will notify various events during its execution. Below is a list of the events
that it will notify, along with the event types and parameters passed.

All events are in the `sf_easy_auth` namespace. Event names should be self explanatory as
to when they events are triggered - but check the code if you need to.

To get the easy auth object associated with an sfUser, use the $sfUser->getAuthUser() 
method.
